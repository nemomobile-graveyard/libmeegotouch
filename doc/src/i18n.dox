/*! \page  i18n  Internationalisation Guidelines

\section  intro  Introduction

This document provides guidelines on developing locale-aware
applications for the DirectUI Framework. Developers, translators, and
user interface designers are the main target audience of this
document.

Generally, as the DirectUI Framework uses Qt as it’s base, some of the Qt
internationalisation practices also applicable. However, the DirectUI
Framework provides additional functionalities, hence it is recommended
that developers always use DirectUI Framework classes to achieve full
internationalisation support in their applications.

This document discusses several general internationalisation
guidelines for user interface designers. They are general enough and
may also be applicable in another projects and vice versa.

\section  localesystem  Locale system
\subsection  localesystemsettings  Settings

The DirectUI locale system uses the following main settings:

<table border="1">
  <caption>
  <big><b>
    DuiLocale main settings
  </b></big>
  </caption>
  <tr>
     <th>gconf key</th>
     <th>description</th>
     <th>example value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>/Dui/i18n/Language</td>
  <td>main language setting</td>
  <td>en_US</td>
  <tr>
  <td>/Dui/i18n/LcTime</td>
  <td>for date, time, and calendar</td>
  <td>ar@calendar=islamic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>/Dui/i18n/LcCollate</td>
  <td>for sorting</td>
  <td>de_DE@collation=phonebook</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>/Dui/i18n/LcNumeric</td>
  <td>formatting of numbers</td>
  <td>hi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>/Dui/i18n/LcMonetary</td>
  <td>for formatting of amounts of money</td>
  <td>fi_FI@currency=EUR</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each of these settings can be set to a ICU locale specifier as
described in the <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale">ICU
User Guide</a>.

The value of \c /Dui/i18n/Language  (“Language”) tells the locale system
about the UI language of the device. This affects all UI texts,
writing direction and widget layouts (It does not affect the user
content, i.e.  it does not affect things like the browser content
language etc.).

“Language” is also used as the default for time, date, calendar,
sorting, number formatting, and currency formatting if the more
specific settings are empty.

“LcTime” selects how time and date are formatted. If it is left empty
the value of “Language” is used. Examples: =ar@calendar\c islamic  means
to format date and time the Arabic way using Islamic calendar,
=ar@calendar\c gregorian  would use Arabic formatting but with Gregorian
calendar, \c fi_FI  would use Finnish formatting rules for time and
date.

“LcCollate” selects how textual data is sorted. If it is left empty
the value of “Language” is used. Examples: =de_DE@collation\c phonebook 
sorts the way German phone books are sorted,
=de_DE@collation\c standard  (or \c de_DE ) sorts the “normal” way German
dictionaries are sorted. =zh_CN@collation\c pinyin  sorts Chinese
according to the pinyin phonetics, =zh_CN@collation\c stroke  sorts
Chinese according to the stroke count of the characters.

“LcNumeric” selects how numbers are formatted. If it is left empty the
value of “Language” is used. Examples: \c hi  formats numbers according
to the rules for the Hindi language, using localized digits, i.e. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numerals">Devanagari
numerals</a> (&#2406;,&#2407;,&#2408;,&#2409;,&#2410;,&#2411;,&#2412;,&#2413;,&#2414;,&#2415;), \c ar  formats numbers
using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabic_numerals">Eastern
Arabic numerals</a> (&#1632;,&#1633;,&#1634;,&#1635;,&#1636;,&#1637;,&#1638;,&#1639;,&#1640;,&#1641;), \c de_CH  formats the Swiss
German way with apostrophes as thousands separators (12'345'670.89),
and \c en_US  formats the American English way (12,345,670.89).

“LcMonetary” selects how currency amounts are formatted. If it is left
empty the value of “Language” is used.

\subsection  localesysteminitialisation  Initialisation

A DirectUI application is normally using the system default DuiLocale object;

\code
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
\endcode

If the application needs to use different locale settings than the
system locale, then a DuiLocale is created by making an instance of a
DuiLocale object:

\code
DuiLocale locale ("fi_FI");
\endcode
where "fi" and "FI" mean to use Finnish language in Finland.

\subsection Collator Collator
To do collation, get the comparator with \c DuiLocale::collator()  method or create it DuiCollator() for default locale collator. This object acts as a functor and can be passed to Qt's \c qSort()  or any other sorting methods. 
The comparator basically does the comparison of two items as "lessThan" function and returns true if the first parameter should come before the second one. 

If other collation system than the locale's default is needed, then use \c setCollation()  method before getting the comparator. After all are set then the sorting can be started by using Qt's \c qSort()  function.

To use the default collation:
\code
QStringList sl; // This contains the strings needed to be sorted
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
DuiCollator c = myLocale.collator(); // getting the comparator
...
qSort(sl.begin, sl.end, c); // start to sort!
...
\endcode

To use the different collation:
\code
QStringList sl; // This contains the strings needed to be sorted
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
myLocale.setCollation (DuiLocale::PhonebookCollation); // sort using German's phonebook sorting order
DuiCollator c = myLocale.collator(); // getting the comparator
...
qSort(sl.begin, sl.end, c); // start to sort!
...
\endcode

\subsection Formatter Formatter
DirectUI comes with several formatters for several data types. (Almost) Always use the formatter before displaying locale-dependant data to the screen to achieve uniformity and consistency of the data presentation.

\subsubsection Parameters Parameters

The positional parameters used in QString is also applicable in the
DirectUI Framework. The difference to Qt is that we don't use any
parameter modifier, and just use number to tell the position of the
parameter in the string. We don't distinguish the parameter whether it
is string, numbers or anything, we just use it as a string.

It is strongly recommended that developers use \c arg()  methods to
arrange the parameters as DirectUI provides type based formatters,
and don't use any format string. QString formatters shall not be used,
as QString uses QLocale which is not used in DirectUI.

The appearance of data is mainly driven using formatters API, not with
the format string. However there are several APIs which accept custom
format strings.

\code
   ...
   DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
   ...
   int number = 1234;
   // format the number, the result is in QString
   QString formattedNumber = myLocale.formatNumber(number);
   ...
   // Now use it in your string

   //% "We have %1 new messages"
   QString message = qtTrId("xx_%1_new_messages").arg(formattedNumber);
\endcode

The above message isn't a good example though because in the above
message one would probably want to distinguish between singular and
plural messages ("We have 0 new messages", "We have 1 new message",
...)

To do this correctly, one should use %n instead of %1 and pass the number
as an additional argument, like this:

\code
   //% "We have %n new messages"
   QString message = qtTrId("xx_%n_new_messages", number);
\endcode

\b <!-- translator --> Note for translators \par
Parameters starts from %1 and the index can be shuffled around in the translations.

*Example:*
- Translation 1: "%1 missed calls from %2"
- Translation 2: "%2 mencoba menelepon %1 kali"
- Text parameter: "3"  "John"
- Final text in language 1: "3 missed calls from John"
- Final text in language 2: "John mencoba menelepon 3 kali"

There is only one special  modifier which is '%%' to display the per cent sign.

Again this isn't a very nice example because it ignores that the
translation must be different for singular and plural.

\subsubsection  numbers  Numbers
To format a number use \c formatNumber()  method. It works with \c qlonglong , \c short , \c int , \c double , and \c float  data types.

\code
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
...
int number = 1234;
QString formattedNumber = myLocale.formatNumber(number); // format the number, the result is in QString
...
\endcode

\subsubsection  dateandtime  Date and time
Use \c formatDateTime()  to format the date and time.
\code
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
...
QDateTime now = QDateTime::currentDateTime();
QString formattedDateTime = myLocale.formatDateTime(now);
...
\endcode

As mentioned previously, date format can also be affected by the device language, region, and calendar settings. 

\code
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
...
QDateTime now = QDateTime::currentDateTime();
QString formattedDateTime = myLocale.formatDateTime(now, DuiLocale::IslamicCalendar); // format using IslamicCalendar
...
\endcode

Custom formatting is supported with ISO-14652 format (also used in libc's \c strftime ) by using \c formatDateTime() .

\subsubsection  percentage  Percentage
\c formatPercent()  is used to format a percentage value.
\code
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
...
double percent = 0.29; // = 29%
int decimals = 2;
QString formattedPercentage = myLocale.formatPercent(percent, decimals);
...
\endcode

\subsubsection Currency Currency
To format any amount of money with a currency, use \c formatCurrency()  method.


\code
...
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
...
double money = 150.40;
QString currency = "EUR";
QString formattedCurrency = myLocale.formatCurrency(money, currency);
...
\endcode

\subsubsection Name Name
Use DuiName class to populate the name information, and use \c DuiLocale::formatName()  method to format the name.

\subsubsection Address Address
Use DuiAddress class to populate the address information, and use \c format()  method to format the name using the format specified as parameter.

\subsection Calendar Calendar
DuiLocale provides Gregorian as well as non-Gregorian calendar support. Use \c formatDateTime()  to format the date according to the custom of the selected calendar.
To set another calendar than the default Gregorian calendar, use \c setCalendar()  method.

\code
DuiLocale myLocale; // get the current locale
...
myLocale.setCalendar(DuiLocale::IslamicCalendar); // set the calendar to use Islamic calendar
...
\endcode

Further date manipulations can be done using DuiCalendar object.

\subsection  iteratingwords  Iterating words
On general case iterating words in a string is not possible by searching whitespace: e.g. thai language just concatenates words and in chinese language a character is a word. For this need a DuiBreakIterator class can be used. It is constructed with a locale and a string and provides an interface for iterating word boundaries. Following example iterates word boundaries from beginning to the end:

\code
DuiLocale myLocale; // current locale
QString text("this is text to be iterated");
DuiBreakIterator iterator(myLocale, text, DuiBreakIterator::WordIterator);
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  int next = iterator.next();
  ...
}
\endcode

\subsubsection  localedatastorage  Locale data storage

\section  translationsystem  Translation system
\subsection  logicalidandengineeringenglish  Logical ID and engineering English

The DirectUI Framework can use both Qt standard \c tr()  method or the
idbased
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6-snapshot/qtglobal.html#qtTrId">qtTrId()</a>
method. For the Nokia internal localisation process, only \c qtTrId() 
should be used.  Other parties using logical IDs instead of
engineering English IDs for the UI messages might also find \c qtTrId() 
useful.

Contrary to the approach of using engineering English as the message
ids, which is commonly practiced in the open source community, the
logical ID approach uses message ids which are guaranteed to be
globally unique.

With \c qtTrId() , the logical ID is a argument of the function and the
engineering English is supplied as a comment above. See the example in
the Qt documentation of
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6-snapshot/qtglobal.html#qtTrId">qtTrId()</a>,
reproduced here for convenience:

\code
   //% "%n fooish bar(s) found.\n"
   //% "Do you want to continue?"
   QString text = qtTrId("qtn_foo_bar", n);
\endcode

\subsection  translationsystemsetup  Translation system setup

To setup the translation system using \c qtTrId() , you
can use the following code snippets in your main function:

By default, the system uses the name of the application executable
(without the directory path) as the name for the file of the
translation catalog and loads this catalog automatically. So you can
start using \c qtTrId()  immediately:

\code
...
int main(int argc, char** argv){
...
   DuiApplication app (argc, argv);
...
   //% "hello"
   qtTrId("xxx_hello");
...
}
...
\endcode

In the above example, if the application executable is for example
\c /usr/bin/foo , i.e. the base file name of the executable is \c foo , the
translation catalog =&lt;top-directory&gt;/foo_&lt;locale-code&gt;.qm= will be
used.

If you need to specify a file for the translation catalog wich differs
from the name of the executable you can use the optional third
parameter \c appIdentifier  of the DuiApplication constructor as in this
example:

\code
...
int main(int argc, char** argv){
...
   DuiApplication application(argc, argv, "bar");
...
   //% "hello"
   qtTrId("xxx_hello");
...
}
...
\endcode

In the above example, the translation catalog
=&lt;top-directory&gt;/bar_&lt;locale-code&gt;.qm= will be used no matter
what the file name of the application executable is.

But note that the \c appIdentifier  is used not only for localization
files but also for themes. I.e. changing the appIdentifier
will also affect themes. Usually this should be no problem because
in most cases these should be kept the same, if possible.

When it is not possible to use the appIdentifier to specify the
translation catalog which should be loaded, one can use the
\c installTrCatalog()  function to load a translation catalog with a
completely different name as in this example:

\code
...
int main(int argc, char** argv){
...
   DuiApplication app (argc, argv);

   // create a DuiLocale. Without parameters in the constructor,
   // it uses defaults from the environment or gconf
   DuiLocale locale;

   // load a different translation catalog for this locale:
   locale.installTrCatalog("othercatalog");

   // the order is important, set the locale as the default *after*
   // installing the translation catalog:
   DuiLocale::setDefault(locale);
...
   // Now this call to qtTrId() will use messages from the translation catalog
   // file othercatalog_<locale-code>.qm:

   //% "hello"
   qtTrId("xxx_hello");
...
}
...
\endcode

To setup your translation using the \c tr()  method known from regular Qt
programs, you can use the \c installTrCatalog()  method as in the
following example:

\code
...
int main(int argc, char** argv){
...
   DuiApplication app (argc, argv);
   // create a DuiLocale. Without parameters in the constructor,
   // it uses defaults from the environment or gconf
   DuiLocale locale;

   // install the catalog for use with tr(). It is probably
   // a good idea to use the application name for "mycatalog":
   locale.installTrCatalog("mycatalog");

   // Make the locale the default to enable the message catalog just
   // installed above for tr(). The order is important, do this *after*
   // installing the translation catalog:
   DuiLocale::setDefault(locale);
...
   // Now you can use tr() as in regular Qt programs:
   tr("hello");
...
}
...
\endcode

\subsection  translatingmessages  Translating messages

\c qtTrId()  is used to translate the UI messages.

\code
   QString qtTrId ( const char * id, int n = -1 )
\endcode

\c id  is the logical name for a UI message which needs to be
translated.
If =n >= 0=, all occurrences of =%n= in the resulting string are replaced
with a decimal representation of \c n . In addition, depending on \c n ’s
value, the translation text may vary.

\c qtTrId()  is useful only if the project is using logical names as the
UI message. If your project is using English string then use \c tr() 
instead.

\subsection  pluralmessages  Plural messages

In a plural message, pass the number into argument \c n  in \c qtTrId()  or
(It is similar to how this is done with \c tr() )

\code
   int n = messages.count();
   //% "%n message(s) saved"
   showMessage(qtTrId("xx_%n_messages_saved", n));
\endcode

\subsection  translationdatastorage  Translation data storage

The convention for the path to store the compiled translation data (in
.qm format) on the device is:

\code
   <top-directory>/<catalog-name>_<locale-code>.qm
\endcode

\c top-directory  can be anywhere on the device. \c locale-code  is
something like \c en_US  for US-English, \c en_GB  for Britisch English,
\c zh_CN  for Simplified Chinese, \c de_DE  for German in Germany, \c de_CH 
for Swiss German, etc. <catalog-name> is usually the name of the
application. If a translation for a more specific locale name like
\c en_US  cannot be found, a less specific locale name like \c en  is
tried. For example, if the application name is \c foo  and the locale
name is \c en_US , the first one of the following files which exists
is used:

\code
<top-directory>/foo_en_US.qm
<top-directory>/foo_en_US
<top-directory>/foo_en.qm
<top-directory>/foo_en
<top-directory>/foo.qm
<top-directory>/foo
\endcode

See also the documentation of
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtranslator.html#load">QTranslator::load()</a>.

The \c top-directory  used by default is `/usr/share/l10n/dui` (This is
defined as \c DUI_TRANSLATION_DIR  in `duiconfig.pri` in the top-level
directory of the libdui source code).

`/usr/share/l10n/dui` is also the default directory used by
translation packages to store the .qm files. Applications can set
additional search paths by using \c DuiLocale::setTranslationPaths() 
and \c DuiLocale::addTranslationPath() . This supports the variability
needed for over-the-air translation installation as well as for user
defined translations.

\subsection  translationdatapackaging  Translation data packaging

The packaging of translations into debian packages is illustrated here
using the demo application “widgetsgallery” as an example.

<table border="1">
  <caption>
     <big><b>
        Example for package names and contents of translation packages
     </b></big>
  </caption>
     <tr>
        <td><b>Package name</b></td>
        <td><b>Contents</b></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>
           dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-engineering-english<br>
        </td>
        <td>
           /usr/share/l10n/dui/widgetsgallery.qm<br>
           /usr/share/doc/dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-engineering-english/widgetsgallery.ts<br>
           /usr/share/doc/dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-engineering-english/changelog.Debian.gz<br>
        </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>
           dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-ar<br>
        </td>
        <td>
           /usr/share/l10n/dui/widgetsgallery_ar.qm<br>
           /usr/share/doc/dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-ar/changelog.Debian.gz<br>
        </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>
           ...<br>
        </td>
        <td>
           ...<br>
        </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>
           dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-zh-cn<br>
        </td>
        <td>
           /usr/share/l10n/dui/widgetsgallery_zh_CN.qm<br>
           /usr/share/doc/dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-zh-cn/changelog.Debian.gz<br>
        </td>
     </tr>
</table>

Every application needing translations should supply also a debian
package containing the “engineering English” translations.  The
package name for the engineering English translations should end with
-l10n-engineering-english as in the above example.  The package name
“...-engineering-english” should make it clear that these are not real
translations, instead they are completely auto-generated from the
source code.

In the above example, the package
“dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-engineering-english” contains
“widgetsgallery.qm” and “widgetsgallery.ts”. “widgetsgallery” is the
name of the application executable. “widgetsgallery.ts” is
automatically generated from the source code using
“lupdate”. “widgetsgallery.qm” is automatically generated from
“widgetsgallery.ts” using “lrelease”. The make files in the
application source code should contain support to do this
automatically when building the application without extra effort (The
current source code of widgetsgallery already gives an example how
this can be done).

The “widgetsgallery.qm” file serves several purposes:

<ol>
<li>

It is used at runtime by the application to display engineering
English instead of message ids to make testing the application easier
while no real translations are available yet.

</li>
<li>

It supplies fallback engineering English when real translations are
available but incomplete. Of course this should never happen in the
final product but it will happen during the development and testing
and then this fallback engineering English is useful.

</li>
<li>

It gives us an easy way to extract a list of ids which are actually
used in the source code. Using the tool “lconvert” one can easily
extract all ids from a .qm file. If all dui-applications supply
“...-l10n-engineering-english” packages, one can easily install all
these packages (for example with “apt-get”) and then extract all ids
which are actually used. Then these ids can be used for cross-checking
with the ids used in the specifications and in the real translations.

</li>
</ol>

“widgetsgallery” is only a test application used by the libdui
developers for testing and demos. Therefore, the localisation
department will not supply translations for “widgetsgallery”.  The
libdui developers supply some demo translations for “widgetsgallery”
to test their code and to make sure the system works.

Only because of this, “widgetsgallery” has some “real” translation
packages like “dui-demos-widgetsgallery-l10n-zh-cn” containing
“/usr/share/l10n/dui/widgetsgallery_zh_CN.qm” (see the table above).
In that respect, “widgetsgallery” is an exception.

For a “real” application, say “camera” which is intended to be shipped
to the customer, the “real” translation packages are supplied by the
translation department, not by the developers. I.e. the developers
will only supply “camera-l10n-engineering-english” and all the other
packages “camera-l10n-ar”, “camera-l10n-zh-cn”, ..., will be supplied
by the translation department.

As long as the real translations are still missing, the engineering
English is displayed. As soon as the real translations are available
and installed, they are used automatically. As can be seen in the
above table, there is no file conflict between the engineering English
packages and the real translations, they can both be installed at the
same time without problems.

For the final product, the engineering English packages can be
omitted. If it has been verified during the testing phase that the
“real” translations are complete, the engineering English is not
needed anymore.

\subsection  translationfordotdesktop  Translation for .desktop files

The translation of .desktop files for DUI differs a bit from the usual
practise of Freedesktop.org. The rationale behind it is that we
have different localisation processes which make it impossible to
modify the source of .desktop files during build time. To accommodate
the special needs of our localisation processes, the .desktop file
shall contain at least two extra (key, value) pairs:

- X-DUI-logical-id=&lt;logical name&gt;: The value for this key provides the logical name of the section name
- X-DUI-translation-catalog=&lt;catalog name&gt;: The value for this key provides the catalog where the logical name exists

For example:
\code
[Desktop Entry]
# engineering english
Name=Setting
# logical name of "Setting"
X-DUI-logical-id=xx_setting_something
# the catalog name
X-DUI-translation-catalog=duisettings
\endcode

For the freedesktop specification of the .desktop files see

<a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/">http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/</a>

In DUI, such .desktop files are parsed using DuiDesktopEntry.

Translation data can be downloaded to the device and the translation
system can immediately use the new downloaded data.

\section  uiprogramming  UI programming

\subsection  localechange  Reacting to changes in the locale settings

The current language setting is stored in the gconf key
\c /Dui/i18n/Language . From the command line, the current language can
be queried using \c gconftool-2  like this:

\code
    ~$ gconftool-2 -g /Dui/i18n/Language
    ar
\endcode

In the above example, the current language is Arabic. Setting
the current language from the command line can of course also be
done with \c gconftool-2 :

\code
    ~$ gconftool-2 -t string -s /Dui/i18n/Language zh_CN
\endcode

The above command sets the current language to simplified Chinese.

The preferred way to query the current language from a \c DuiApplication 
works like this:

\code
    DuiLocale currentLocale;
    QString language = currentLocale.name();
\endcode

=DuiLocale currentLocale;= gets a copy of the system default locale
which is connected to the gconf settings and follows the gconf
settings.

Alternatively it is possible to read the gconf settings directly:

\code
    DuiGConfItem languageItem("/Dui/i18n/Language");
    QString language = languageItem.value().toString();
\endcode

This has the same effect as getting the current system locale and
using =currentLocale.name()=.

Setting the current language permanently from a \c DuiApplication  works like
this:

\code
    DuiGConfItem languageItem("/Dui/i18n/Language");
    languageItem.set("zh_CN");
\endcode

One can also set a new current language temporarily from a \c DuiApplication 
by doing:

\code
    DuiLocale newLocale("zh_CN");
    DuiLocale::setDefault(newLocale);
\endcode

This does not change the gconf settings and therefore this change will
be lost as soon as one of the locale related gconf keys changes
again. And it will be lost when the application restarts. Nevertheless
this can be useful for temporary changes for testing and it is
currently the only way to change the current language on systems
without gconf like Windows or Mac OSX.

If a the system locale changes, either because a locale related gconf
key changed or because \c DuiLocale::setDefault()  has been called
explicitly by the application, the following things happen:

<ul>
<li>
all translation catalogs are reloaded according to the new locale
settings
</li>
<li>
\c QEvent::LanguageChange  will be sent to the Application, if
necessary. \c DuiWindow  will propagate a \c QEvent::LanguageChange  to all
\c DuiWidgets  on the scene. A \c DuiWidget  which receives this event by
calls its \c retranslateUi()  method.
</li>
<li>
\c QEvent::ApplicationLayoutDirectionChange  will be sent to the
Application, if necessary.  \c DuiWindow  will propagate a
\c QEvent::LayoutDirectionChange  to all \c DuiWidgets  as appropriate to
enable the widgets to change their layout on the fly.
</li>
<li>
The signal \c settingsChanged()  will be emitted by the locale.
</li>
<li>
The signal \c localeSettingsChanged()  will be emitted by the
\c DuiApplication .
</li>
</ul>

In most cases, an application doesn’t have to use the above signals
\c settingsChanged()  and \c localeSettingsChanged()  because most
stuff like reloading the translation catalogs already happens
automatically. If \c retranslateUi()  methods are implemented
for the widgets used in the application, the language of the
user interface will already change automatically.

Optionally, an application can use these signals though, if it
wants to do additional special things which do not happen
automatically.
For example:

\code
main.cpp:

    #include "foohandlelocalechange.h"
    ...
    int main (int argc, char **argv)
    {
        ...
        FooHandleLocaleChange fooHandleLocaleChange;
        QObject::connect(&application, SIGNAL(localeSettingsChanged()), &fooHandleLocaleChange, SLOT(fooHandleLocaleChange()));
        ...
    }
\endcode

where the FooHandleLocaleChange class looks like:

\code
foohandlelocalechange.h:

    class FooHandleLocaleChange : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT

    public slots:
        void fooHandleLocaleChange();
    };


foohandlelocalechange.cpp:

    void FooHandleLocaleChange::fooHandleLocaleChange()
    {
       // do whatever is needed when the system locale
       // changes, but remember that the basic stuff like
       // reloading the translation catalogs and  changing the layout
       // direction already happens automatically.
       //
       // Therefore, unless you have very special needs, you do not
       // need to do anything here.
       //
       // In any case, do *not* do anything here which changes the
       // system default locale again because this would trigger
       // an endless loop.
    }
\endcode

----++++ <!-- retranslateui --> The retranslateUi() method of DuiWidget

A \c DuiWidget  which receives the \c QEvent::LanguageChange  calls its
virtual method

\code
    virtual void retranslateUi();
\endcode

\c DuiWidgets  can reimplement this \c retranslateUi()  method to do whatever
is necessary to retranslate itself, as in the following example:

\code
foopage.h

    class FooPage : public DuiWidget
    {
    ...
    private:
    ...
        DuiLabel* label;
    ...
    };

foopage.cpp

    void FooPage::createContent()
    {

        label = new DuiLabel();

        retranslateUi();
    }

    void FooPage::retranslateUi()
    {
    ...
        //% "Label Text"
        propertiesLabel->setText(qtTrId("qtn_label_text"));
    ...
    }
\endcode

This can be quite tricky in some cases but makes it possible to
re-translate the user interface of an application on the fly if the
locale settings change. 

<!-- This can be quite tricky in some cases, therefore we are thinking -->
<!-- about adding a convenience API for the DuiWidgets to make -->
<!-- reimplementing \c retranslateUi()  not necessary in many cases. -->

\subsection  widgetmirroring  Widget mirroring and layout direction
Widget mirroring is the automatic behaviour of putting the widgets in the reverse direction when the language is switched to Right-to-left languages (such as Arabic or Hebrew). In this direction, the widgets are put following the natural flow of text writing direction. Widget mirroring works automatically when the widgets are arranged using QGraphicsLayout or DuiLayout, with some exceptions with the specialist DuiLayout policies.

The layout direction will be automatically set to the correct value by DuiApplication when the language is changed. The current layout direction can be obtained from \c DuiApplication::layoutDirection() . Note that during the application lifetime, the direction may change if the user changes it from the global setting.

If you are developing a widget in which it does not make sense for the layout to be reversed (for example, a number keypad), then use \c QGraphicsWidget::setLayoutDirection()  to override the layout direction.  If you need to paint your widget differently in right-to-left mode, simply call `qApp->layoutDirection()` and draw as appropriate.  If you are implementing a custom DuiAbstractLayoutPolicy, however, you should use the \c DuiLayout::layoutDirection() function instead so that the user can override it.

In advanced situations you can handle the \c QEvent::ApplicationLayoutDirectionChange()  event directly in your widget's event handler.

layout direction, you see that the these names which were originally
"almost" centred are aligned right in RTL mode. They should be aligned
in a mirrored way, i.e. if they are a bit left of the centre in LTR
mode, they should be a bit right of the centre in RTL mode.
Is this a problem with DuiApplicationMenu or with DuiAction?

mode, the gray squares align with the blue buttons, i.e. on top of
each gray square is a blue button. In LTR mode, the two arrays
are shifted against each other. This doesn't look right.

\section  charsetconversion  Charset Conversions

The DirectUI Framework uses the Qt character set conversion
mechanisms directly. Therefore, developers can follow the Qt
documentation to find out how to use the character set conversion
functionalities.

\section  generalchecklist  General Checklist

\subsection General General
\subsubsection  fontsize  Fonts size

Some languages require bigger font size than the one used in the
English text. This may impact the layout design.

\subsubsection Plural Plural

Some languages use plural and some do not. Some other languages use
more than one form of plurals.

\subsubsection Sorting Sorting

Sorting order is dependent on the language setting. Always use
DirectUI collator to sort the strings.

\subsubsection  wordboundaries  Word boundaries

In some languages there is no space between words. In most cases the
line wrapping will work and the system will break the sentence into
smaller chunks. If it fails, translators shall use whitespace to force
word boundaries.

\subsubsection  wordorder  Word order, variables

When a sentence contains several variables, the order of the words in
other languages may be different. Use QString place marker to define
the order of the variables.

\code
   //% "Download and install %1 from %2? (Size is %3 MB)"
   QString s = qtTrId("xx_download_and_install_%1_from_%2_size_%3_mb")
                   .arg(packageName).arg(repository).arg(size);
\endcode

When translating, translators shall also keep the place markers and
put them in the correct places.

\subsection Developers Developers
\subsubsection  alwaysusedui  Always use DirectUI Framework API

This is the general checklist which need to be confirmed during the
development. Use only DirectUI Framework locale system API to gain
full internationalisation support. Use of POSIX and libc API is not
recommended and may cause discrepancies in the representation of the
data.

To do sorting, never use Qt's QString localeAwareCompare(), use
DirectUI collation system instead.

\subsubsection  avoidhardcoding  Avoid hardcoding

Some data such as graphics, icons, sounds, etc sometimes need to be
correctly loaded dependent on the regional setting. In this case,
never hard code the data directory, instead use the regional setting
information to build the string to point to the correct directory
containing the data.

\subsubsection  neverconcatstrings  Never concatenate strings

If you need to construct a string involving variables, never concate
the UI strings. The string order is never guaranteed to the same in
all languages. Never do this:

\code
   QString message = "You have " + numMessages + " messages";
\endcode

Instead use a variable when constructing the string:
\code
   //% "You have %1 messages"
   QString message = qtTrId("xx_you_have_%1_messages").arg(numMessages);
\endcode

\subsubsection  dataformat  Data formatting

Date, time, numbers, name, address, currency data are required to be
formatted before displayed on the screen. Never display unformatted
data as it breaks the data presentation consistency. Formatted data
always use the correct presentation according to the regional
setting. Special case for address data, it shall be formatted
according to the customary of the country which stated in the address.

\subsection  uidesign  UI Designers
\subsubsection Abbreviations Abbreviations

In general, avoid using abbreviations as part of the UI string. The
abbreviations ofter are misleading and confuse the
translators. Instead, allow for more text expansion

\subsubsection Emphasis Emphasis

Never use casing when indicating functionality or emphasis. Some
languages do not observe distinction between lowercase and
uppercase. The translator may have difficulties to find out how to
emphasise the string when the original English string uses uppercase for
the emphasis.

Other methods such as using certain typeface to show emphasis also
discouraged as not all writing systems support them.

\subsubsection  characterrepertoire  Character repertoire

Never use characters outside the ASCII repertoire as part of original
English strings. The font needed to display the character may not
available in the device variant used for other languages.

\subsubsection Compounds Compounds

Some languages create words by combining a few words together. The
resulting words are often longer than the original English
string. Make sure that the UI allows the text expansion in these
languages.

\subsubsection Digits Digits

Some languages use their own digits (term: national digits) to show
the numbers. Allow the usage of national digits in some cases (for
example when displaying general strings containing numbers) and force
the UI to only use the Latin digits in other cases (for example when
displaying IP addresses).

\subsubsection  writingdirection  Writing direction

Some languages use different writing direction than the Latin based
languages. The UI presentation generally follows the natural flow of
the writing direction. Therefore, the widget layout and composition is
mirrored when the device language is set to the languages which use
the right-to-left writing direction. The mirroring is done
automatically by the DirectUI Framework. If the automatic mirroring is
not sufficient then consult the developers to support different layout
for right-to-left direction.

DirectUI Framework currently only supports left-to-right and
right-to-left writing directions.

\subsubsection Gender Gender

Some languages use gender when referring to objects or words. 

\subsubsection  colorandgraphics  Colour and graphics

Colours often have different meanings and connotations in different
cultures. In Western culture, red is often used to indicate stop or
danger. In China, red is symbolic of celebration, luck and
prosperity. White signifies purity, virginity, or death. In Western
culture it is the colour worn at weddings. In parts of Japan and China
the colour worn at funerals.

Never embed text and/or numbers in graphics, otherwise the graphics
need to be translated and it may be difficult and expensive.

Some icons or drawings considered offensive in some cultures. 

\subsubsection  slitstrings  Split strings when containing date and time format

See section "Translation involving date/time format" above.
