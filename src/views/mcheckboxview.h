    \section MCheckboxViewOverview Overview

        <TABLE border="0">
        <TR>
            <TD> \image html checkbox_off.png </TD>
            <TD> \image html checkbox_on.png </TD>

        Checkbox is a variant of button that allows users to set a state of a
        variable or setting which has two values, On and Off. Checkbox essentially
        does the same thing as the Switch variant.

    \section MCheckboxViewInteractions Interactions
        Users can change the state of checkbox by tapping on it (or the accompanying
        text label). If the state of the checkbox is On, it is changed to Off.
        If the state of the checkbox is On, it is changed to Off. If the checkbox
        is disabled the tapping has not effect.

          - <b>Press down</b>: Highlights the checkbox.
          - <b>Tap</b> (button down + button up): Toggles the state of
          the checkbox.
          - <b>Tap down and drag finger out of the checkbox and release finger</b>:
          Cancels the press and does not change the state.
          - <b>Tap down and drag finger to scroll UI</b>: Cancels the press
          and does not change the state.

    \section MCheckboxViewOpenIssues Open issues
        - Checkbox should include a text label describing the setting or variable
        in question. This label has the same interactions as the Checkbox button itself.
