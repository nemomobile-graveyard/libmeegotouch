    \class MApplicationMenuView
    \brief View class for MApplicationMenu.

    \ingroup views

    \section MApplicationMenuViewOverview Overview
        MApplicationMenuView is used to visualize actions placed into the MApplicationMenu.
        MApplicationMenuView appears once the user clicks on the view menu title area. It is opened on
        top of the current application view. Background of the view is dimmed/blurred when application
        menu is open. The outlook of view menu can be changed using the styling attributes defined in
        MApplicationMenuStyle and MSceneWindowStyle.

        The following action widgets are supported for this particular view:
        - Button, Icon button variant
        - Combobox

        \subsection MApplicationMenuViewCommands Commands
         - There are two main types of commands: view style commands and action commands
         - The view style commands set the style/order/presentation of the contents of the view, while
           still staying inside the same view. Examples of style commands include a setting for list/grid
           style presentation for the current view, or setting abc/recent/favourites sorting order for
           the contents of the view
         - Style commands are grouped and mutually exclusive, so only one can be selected at any time.
         - Action commands can open new views or dialogs, essentially leaving the current view and presenting
           a new UI, in the same task or then in a new task
         - The view can contain only view style commands, only action commands, or both of them
         - The view style and action commands are grouped together and presented separately; the view
           style commands always first (on the top of the menu)
         - In portrait mode, the commands are presented one item per row, vertically from top to bottom
         - In landscape mode, the commands are presented in two items per row, horizontally from left to
           right, then from top to bottom.
         - The user should be able to turn the device orientation after opening the menu, which will redraw
           the menu in the new orientation.
         - Maximum number of action commands is 8, and in presence of style commands, maximum number of
           action commands reduces to 6.

    \section MApplicationMenuInteractions Interactions
        - The view can be closed by tapping anywhere outside the menu (anywhere in the dimmed area)
        - The view can also be closed from the top of screen (from the view menu title, or the top right corner)
        - Selecting an action command from the view menu closes the menu
        - Selecting a view style command closes the view menu and sets the view and its contents in
          the newly selected style.
