/*!
 * Dismiss events are sent to scene windows that the user wants to dismiss. Usually
 * by tapping the back button (for DuiApplicationPage), a close button (e.g. in the
 * title bar of a DuiDialog) or by tapping outside a modal scene window. They are
 * also sent when you call DuiSceneWindow::dismiss() to dismiss a scene window
 * programmatically.
 *
 * Dismiss events contain a flag that indicates whether the receiver wants the
 * scene window to be dismissed or not. When a scene window accepts the dismiss
 * event, it disappears (and is destroyed if DuiSceneWindow::DestroyWhenDone
 * was used). If it refuses to accept the dismiss event nothing happens.
 * The event handler DuiScenewindow::dismissEvent() receives dismiss events. The
 * default implementation of this event handler accepts the dismiss event. If
 * you do not want your scene window to disappear, or want some special handing,
 * you should reimplement the event handler and ignore() the event.
 *
 * The difference between DuiDismissEvent and QCloseEvent is that the former
 * causes the scene window to disappear (which makes it leave the scene with an
 * optionally animated transition and finally hides it) where the latter only
 * hides the scene window (it will still occupy the scene and no transition
 * animation will take place).
 *
 * If you want the scene window to be deleted after it disappears, pass
 * DuiSceneWindow::DestroyWhenDone when calling DuiSceneWindow::appear() or
 * DuiSceneWindow::appearNow(). This is very useful for independent scene windows.
 *
 * QObjects emits the destroyed() signal when they are deleted.
 *
 * The isAccepted() method returns true if the event's receiver has agreed to
 * dismiss the scene window; call accept() to agree to dismiss the scene window
 * and call ignore() if the receiver of this event does not want the scene window
 * to be closed.
