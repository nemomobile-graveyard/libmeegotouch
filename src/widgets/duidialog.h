    \class DuiDialog
    \brief The DuiDialog class is the base class of dialog windows.

    \ingroup widgets

    \section DuiDialogOverview Overview
    DuiDialog is a top-level scene window mostly used for short-term tasks and
    brief communications with the user. It can either be embedded in an existing DuiWindow
    (and therefore be application modal) or displayed in its own separate DuiWindow
    (which may be system modal). DuiDialogs are never modeless.


    A DuiDialog is comprised by three components:

    \li A title bar containig a title text, a progress indicator and a close button.
        The close button, the progress indicator or the entire title bar can be hidden.
        The progress indicator is hidden by default.
    \li A customizable central widget, that is meant to contain either the message or query
        for the user, or the content requesting user's selection.
    \li A button box, that can contain buttons for providing means of selection for simple queries.
        Can be hidden when central widget is customized.

    DuiDialog may be application modal or system modal. When displayed inside a given
    DuiWindow (by supplying a window parameter to appear(), appearNow() or exec())
    it will ignore the systemModal property and will be application modal. If
    no window is supplied and systemModal is set to true it will be displayed in its own
    separate top-level DuiWindow and will be system modal. The home button is not accessible
    when DuiDialog is system modal. DuiDialog is application modal by default.

    DuiDialog provides a return value, based on the user's choice. It also knows which button from
    the button box was pressed (if any).

    \section DuiDialogUseGuidelines Usage guidelines
    It is not always instantly clear whether to use a DuiDialog or DuiApplicationPage in your
    application, here are some characteristics and guidelines for making the decision:

    <table class="qt-style">
        <tr><th>Use an application page when...</th><th>Use a dialog when...</th></tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When you have a main task in the application; one page for each main task.</td>
            <td>When you are performing a secondary task related to the contents within the
                view.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When you are staying inside the contents of particular application.</td>
            <td>When you are utilizing information from some other application source only as
                intermediate step, to avoid branching away.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When you want to return to this step when pressing \em Back from following page.</td>
            <td>When it does not make sense to return to this step after pressing Back from
                following page.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>You need a complex UI for the selection; many levels, functionalities, different
                styles etc.</td>
            <td>A simple selection is enough, the action can be quickly finished, optionally with
                one click.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>When you need multiple instances of the same action (compose multiple separate
                emails at the same time, each in their own page.)</td>
            <td>When multiple instances do not make sense (for instance \em Select \em Connection
                is a dialog, since it does not make sense to have two of them open at the same
                time.)</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

    \section DuiDialogVariants Variants
        \li DuiMessageBox is designed for asking the user simple yes/no-type of questions.
            It contains text in its central area and has the title bar hidden.
        \li DuiPopupList is for picking one option from several alternatives.
            It has no button box, closes immediately after user makes selection.

    \section DuiDialogExamples Examples
    Constructing an entry dialog:
    \code
        DuiWidget *centralWidget = new DuiWidget;
        QGraphicsLinearLayout *layout = new QGraphicsLinearLayout(Qt::Vertical);

        DuiLabel *label = new DuiLabel("Name", centralWidget);
        DuiTextEdit *textEdit = new DuiTextEdit(DuiTextEditModel::SingleLine,
                                                 QString(),
                                                 centralWidget);
        centralWidget->setLayout(layout);

        layout->addItem(label);
        layout->addItem(textEdit);

        DuiDialog* dialog = new DuiDialog("Please enter your name",
                               centralWidget,
                               Dui::OkButton | Dui::ResetButton);

        dialog->exec();
    \endcode

    Constructing a question dialog, it is easier to use DuiMessageBox instead:
    \code
    DuiDialog* dialog = new DuiDialog("Question",
        new DuiLabel("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet?"),
        Dui::YesButton | Dui::NoButton);
    dialog->exec();
    \endcode

    \sa DuiDialogView, DuiDialogStyle
