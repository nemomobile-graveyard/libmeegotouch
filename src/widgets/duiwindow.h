  \class DuiWindow
  \brief DuiWindow is the base class for all DirectUI windows

  A DirectUI window is completely empty by default. For developing an application
  conforming to the DirectUI style, use DuiApplicationWindow instead.

  A DirectUI window is a QGraphicsView widget that visualizes the contents
  of the application scene. The key differences compared to the standard
  QGraphicsView is:

  - The coordinate system of a DuiWindow starts with (0,0) in the top-left corner
    and does typically not change during an application's execution.
  - DuiWindows have an OpenGL viewport by default, which causes QPainter commands
    for the window to use one of Qt's OpenGL backends.
  - Fullscreen updates are enabled by default for the window, as OpenGL partial
    updates are not supported in Qt.
  - New concept of window orientation. DirectUI applications change orientation through
    a scene graph transformation. The window widget coordinates stay the same
    after an orientation change while the root element of the scene graph can have
    an arbitary transformation angle. See \ref rotation.
  - New concept of scene management. DirectUI supports in-scene variants of traditional
    UI components such as dialogs, popups and menus. DuiSceneManager acts like an
    in-application window manager to orchestrate the various components.
  - New concept of display visibility. DirectUI applications typically operate in
    a fully composited environment, meaning that a shown window still doesn't
    guarantee that it is visible. Display visibility tells whether the user is
    able to see the window.

  Example: Showing scene windows on DuiWindow.

  \code
      DuiApplication app;
      DuiWindow window;
      DuiSceneWindow *sceneWindow = new DuiMessageBox("Hello World!");

      window.show();

      sceneWindow->appear(&window);

      app.exec();
  \endcode

     This method usually should be called only once, before showing the window.

     \note Setting this property to true locks orientation changes,
