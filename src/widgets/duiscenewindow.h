 * \class DuiSceneWindow
 * \brief DuiSceneWindow objects are the base graphical items in a Direct UI scene.
 *
 * All graphical components of a standard Direct UI application are held in
 * a DuiSceneWindow of some type. DuiSceneWindow instances form the base
 * level of a Direct UI application's scene graph.
 *
 * DuiSceneWindows in a DuiScene are analogous to top level windows in a
 * traditional windowing system.
 *
 * The actual size and position of a DuiSceneWindow are by default managed by
 * DuiSceneManager according to DuiSceneWindowStyle properties. If you want to
 * manually resize and position a DuiSceneWindow you have to explicitly set
 * the managedManually property to true.
