  \class MScalableImage
  \brief MScalableImage is a class for drawing scaled pixmaps into screen
         without breaking the boundaries of the image.

  The image is constructed from 9 blocks and it is scalable in every direction.

            &lt;corner&gt; &lt;h_edge&gt; &lt;corner&gt;
            &lt;v_edge&gt; &lt;center&gt; &lt;v_edge&gt;
            &lt;corner&gt; &lt;h_edge&gt; &lt;corner&gt;

  The scalable area of the image is defined using the left, right, top and bottom
  border parameters. The borders are defined as pixels and they cannot be larger
  than the used source pixmap.

  The corner blocks are not scaled at all. The horizontal edges (h_edge) are
  scaled only horizontally and the vertical edges (v_edge) only vertically. The
  center block is scaled vertically and horizontally if needed. The size inputted
  into one the draw() methods cannot be smaller than the defined borders.

  \note Due to a known bug in Qt 4.7 trying to render a scaled image with the defined
        borders resulting in empty blocks (zero borders or borders covering the
        entire image) can result in graphical glitches in certain cases. The image
        will be rendered with automatically adjusted borders in such situations.
        Zero borders will be adjusted to 1 and borders covering the entire image will
        be reduced.
