    \section MNotificationOverview Overview
        A class that represents a notification group. Notification groups can be
        used to bundle similar notifications into one so that the individual
        notifications join a group of notifications on the notification area.

        A notification group is not created or updated until the publish() function
        is called. A notification group must be published before notifications are
        placed into it.

        A list of notification groups already created can be requested.
        A QCoreApplication must be created before doing the request.
