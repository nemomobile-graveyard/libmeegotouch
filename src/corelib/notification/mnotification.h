    \class MNotification
    \brief A class that represents a notification.

    \ingroup widgets

    \section MNotificationOverview Overview
        Notifications provide means to communicate system information and status updates to the user,
        without blocking the UI or requiring the user to switch to another view. Notifications can be
        done through visual, audio or haptic means.

        Dialogs and notifications are related to each other, but separate components. All Dialogs are modal,
        i.e. elements that do not go away from the screen without requiring user interactions, whereas all
        notifications are temporal elements (i.e. modeless) that do not require interactions from the user
        (although they can sometimes also provide them).

        Certain notifications are related to the communication activities (like SMS, email, feed updates etc.),
        and notifications relating to application and system behaviour (like connection lost, battery low etc.).
        Communication activities display incoming event notifications.

        A notification is not created or updated until the publish() function is called.

        A list of notifications already created can be requested, but in this case a MApplication
        instance must have been created before any notifications were created and before the request
        itself. It should also be noted that currently all properties of such notifications need to be
        set before publishing changes to the notification. Otherwise the properties of the notification
        will be lost.

    \section MNotificationInteractions Interactions
        Notifications can be non-interactive (for information only) or interactive: the interactive
        notifications provide information, but they also provide a way for interacting with the notification,
        for example to fix a connectivity problem. Notifications are always modeless components - modal
        "notifications" are specified with Dialogs. Images on this page are for illustrational purposes only.
        In case that images and text conflict each other, the text should be followed.

    \section MNotificationUsageGuidelines Usage guidelines
        \li Notifications are intended to communicate information when the foreground application UI is not
            able to do this. If the foreground application UI can already communicate the information, a
            separate Notification shouldn't be shown anymore.
        \li Notifications are temporal elements, i.e. they are dismissed from screen after a certain time
            (or timeout).
        \li Incoming events aim to provide a centralized method for applications to provide persistent
            notifications to the users.
        \li Use non-interactive notifications (status banners) to display feedback/progress/notifications for
            successful actions, if other parts of the foreground UI cannot be directly utilized.
        \li Consider using interactive status banners for notifications in error cases, exceptions etc. that
            can either be dismissed or then reacted upon. The interactive elements are essentially shortcut
            functions, intended to save time from the users. No use case should fail because the user fails to
            press the interactive status banner.
        \li MInfoBanner class can be used to show information banners in a single application. However,
            such banners are only shown inside the application using them, no sounds or other feedbacks are
            played and the banners are not aware of the current policy or profile in any way.

    \section MNotificationPersistence Persistence
        Notifications created as persistent are stored by the notification system and are returned by the
        MNotification::notifications() even after a reboot. It should be noted that currently all properties
        of such notifications need to be set before publishing changes to the notification. Otherwise the
        properties of the notification will be lost.

        \note A MApplication instance must be created before creating any persistent notifications.
