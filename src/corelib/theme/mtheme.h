 \class MTheme
 \brief MTheme abstracts the theming and styling of DirectUI applications and widgets

 MTheme is a singleton class providing runtime access to the DirectUI theming parameters,
 as well as factory methods for instantiating various theming resources such as shared
 graphical assets in the form of QPixmaps and MScalableImages as well as style and view
 objects for widgets.

 MTheme communicates asynchronously with a theme server whenever a graphical asset
 is requested. The theme server is responsible for loading the graphics (either from
 static image files, by rasterizing SVG or through procedural generation) and sharing them.
 The sharing of graphics assets is platform specific, DirectUI ships with a reference theme
 server called MThemeDaemon that shares assets using X11. A local theme server can also
 be created in-process, however in this case no sharing occurs and each graphical asset
 instantiated is duplicated for the application.

     Constructs the MTheme instance.

     By default the theme system firsrt attempts to connect to a remote theme service,
     if this fails a local theme service is created unless overriden by the \a themeService parameter.
     Note that on some platforms failing to connect to a remote theme service at startup may be a fatal error.
     If the \a themeService is RemoteTheme, the constructor will not return until a remote theme service becomes
     available. This option should be used when the application may potentially start before the theme service
     during system bootup. The RemoteTheme option can also be toggled by the -remote-theme command line parameter
     as passed to MApplication. The RemoteTheme option cannot be used if imglistFilename is also set.


     \a applicationName is used as the first part of the search path for resources, ensuring that application
     specific theme resources are prioritized. If \a imglistFilename is passed, MTheme will create a local
     theme daemon and output the list of used images to the specified file.

     Returns the style object matching the given parameters.

     A style object is a collection of data properties, from which widget views (or any other
     type of class) access their run time parameters. The data is in the form of standard Qt properties
     and the style object is automatically filled through Qt property introspection based
     on values defined in CSS sylesheets.

     Ownership of the returned object remains with MTheme, the caller must
     not delete it as it may be shared by multiple users. Once the caller no longer needs the
     object, it should be passed to the releaseStyle method of MTheme.

     The parameters are:

     - \a styleClassName, the name of the class (e.g. "MLabelStyle")
     - \a objectName, the name of the object (e.g. "MyButton")
     - \a mode, the name of the mode of the widget (e.g. "active", "selected", "disabled")
     - \a type, the type of view that is used (e.g. for the button: "default", "checkbox", "toggle")
     - \a orientation, the orientation that the style should be optimized for (e.g portrait or landscape)
     - \a parent (optional), the controller of the widget for which the style is used

     Returns a QPixmap that contains the graphical asset specified by the logical identifier.

     The \a id is a logical identifier for a single graphical theme asset. The source format of the
     graphics is abstracted and determined by the theme service. The default MThemeDaemon theme
     policy is as follows:

     - Static images such as PNG have a higher priority than assets which are dynamic or require
     rasterization (SVG), thus allowing for caching of dynamic assets. For static images the
     id is the filename without the suffix.
     - Application supplied assets have higher priority than base theme assets, while assets in
     a theme for a specific application has higher priority than assets supplied by the application itself.

     The \a size parameter determines the size of the returned pixmap. The default \a size of QSize(0,0) marks
     that the original pixmap size should be used.

     The requested pixmap is loaded asynchronously. The returned pixmap can therefore be one of the following:

     - The real pixmap if the pixmap was already loaded by the system.
     - A transparent gray 1x1 or \a size sized pixmap, serving as a placeholder while the pixmap is loading.
     - A red pixmap of 50x50 pixels size, indicating that the pixmap with the requested id was not found.

     In the first two cases, the pixmap data can be changed at any time by the theme. This may happen when
     the theme changes, pixmaps are updated, pixmaps finish loading or for any other reason.
