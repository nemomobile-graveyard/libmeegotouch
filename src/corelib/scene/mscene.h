 \class MScene
 \brief MScene is the scene graph of MeeGo Touch UI applications

 The scene of an application is a virtual infinite surface on which primitive items or
 full featured widgets can be placed. For general information of how the scene functions,
 please refer to the QGraphicsScene documentation.

 MScene inherits from and extends QGraphicsScene with the following features:

 - Automatic scene management. MSceneWindow derived classes such as MApplicationPage or MDialog
   become managed by a MSceneManager instance when they appear in a MSceene. The feature is comparable
   to how native windows are managed by a window manager in desktop environments.
 - Emulation of multitouch events for single-touch enviroments, as in a development environment.
 - Calcuation of the widget on-display property, see MWidget::isOnDisplay()
 - Development mode visual overlays, providing information to help debug applications:
    - Bounding rectangles, toggled by <Ctrl>-B
    - Margins, toggled by <Ctrl>-M
    - Positions, toggled by <Ctrl>-P
    - Sizes, toggled by <Ctrl>-S
    - Object names, toggled by <Ctrl>-N
    - Frames per second, toggled by <Ctrl>-F
