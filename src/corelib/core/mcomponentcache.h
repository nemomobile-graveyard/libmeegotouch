 * \class MComponentCache
 * \brief MComponentCache contains objects instantiated before running main().
 *
 * MComponentCache enables performance boost on application start-up
 * times by offering a storage for objects instantiated and
 * initialized before launching the application.
 *
 * Launchers like applauncherd populate this cache before loading the
 * application binary. The application should pick up the objects
 * fromt the cache instead of creating new ones. In particular, the
 * MApplication instance must be read from the cache as follows. For
 * instance, replace
 *
 * MApplication myApp(argc, argv);
 *
 * by
 *
 * MApplication *myApp = MComponentCache::mApplication(argc, argv);
 *
 * As a consequence, this prevents inheriting MApplication in
 * applications that use MComponentCache.
 *
 * If the launcher has not populated the cache, this will create a new
 * MApplication instance. Thus the same application work with and
 * without the launcher.
 *
 * The ownership of the objects returned from the cache is passed to
 * the caller.
