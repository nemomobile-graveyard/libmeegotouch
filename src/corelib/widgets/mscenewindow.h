/*!
 * \class MSceneWindow
 * \brief MSceneWindow objects are the base graphical items in a MeeGo Touch scene.
 *
 * All graphical components of a standard MeeGo Touch application are held in
 * a MSceneWindow of some type. MSceneWindow instances form the base
 * level of a MeeGo Touch application's scene graph.
 *
 * MSceneWindows in a MScene are analogous to top level windows in a
 * traditional windowing system.
 *
 * The actual size and position of a MSceneWindow are by default managed by
 * MSceneManager according to MSceneWindowStyle properties. If you want to
 * manually resize and position a MSceneWindow you have to explicitly set
 * the managedManually property to true.
 *
 * \section appear_methods Appearing and disappearing scene windows
 *
 * Scene windows introduce a new concept: They also appear and disappear
 * instead of just being shown and hidden like regular graphics items.
 *
 * Thus the family of methods appear()/disappear()/dismiss()/sceneWindowState()
 * is different from show()/hide()/close()/isVisible().
 *
 * The second group revolves around the isVisible() property which has its
 * meaning defined in the documentation of QGraphicsItem::setVisible().
 *
 * The first group is a higher level concept introduced by MSceneWindow/MSceneManager
 * and is about the scene manager taking a scene window, adding it to the scene
 * managed by him and setting its proper position, size, z value, parent item,
 * etc (usually with animated transitions).
 *
 * \section scenewindow_management Managed scene windows
 *
 * After a scene window has been added to a scene manager (through an appear() call),
 * the following attributes are controlled by that scene manager and therefore
 * should not be manually modified:
 *    - scene()
 *    - parentItem()
 *    - zValue()
 *    - rotation()
 *    - scale()
 *    - transformOriginPoint()
 *    - isVisible()
 *
 * In addition to those, if isManuallyManaged() is false, the following
 * attributes will also be under scene manager control:
 *    - pos()
 *    - size()
 *    - geometry()
 *
 * Manually changing attributes that are under the control of a scene manager
 * is not supported and can lead to unpredictable behavior.
 *

    /*!
       \brief This enum defines how to handle scene window after hiding it using disappear() or dismiss().

        We have both DestroyWhenDone + disappear() and DestroyWhenDismissed + dismiss() to
        cover the use case where you want your scene windows to be deleted \b only when
        they are no longer in the page history.

        Example:

        When drilling down (from root page to sub page and then to sub-sub page) you
        want your previous pages (root page and sub page) to be kept alive since the
        user might go back to them by pressing a back button (which calls dismiss()
        on current page). But once the user have moved away from a page for good
        (pressed back on sub-sub page, reaching sub page), that page can be deleted
        (sub-sub page gets deleted). You will get that for free by using DestroyWhenDismissed.

        If you use DestroyWhenDone for your pages you will never be able to go back to
        them in a drill down navigational pattern as they will be deleted as soon as
        they leave the screen. If you use DestroyWhenDismissed they will only be
        deleted if they get dismissed, for instance, by the user via the back button.
