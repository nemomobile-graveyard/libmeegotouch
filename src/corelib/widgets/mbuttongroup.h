    \class MButtonGroup
    \brief MButtonGroup organizes groups of button widgets.

    \ingroup widgets

    \section MButtonGroupOverview Overview

        MButtonGroup does not provide a visual representation of this grouping,
        instead it manages the states of each of the buttons in the group.

        An exclusive button group switches off all checkable (toggle) buttons
        except the one that was clicked. By default, a button group is exclusive.
        The buttons in a button group are usually checkable buttons. Non-checkable
        buttons can be added into group as well but they don't affect the button
        selection policy at all, however the interaction signals are emitted normally
        for them too.

        If you create an exclusive button group, you should ensure that one of
        the buttons in the group is initially checked; otherwise, the group
        will initially be in a state where no buttons are checked.

        A button is added to the group with addButton(). It can be removed from
        the group with removeButton(). If the group is exclusive, the currently
        checked button is available as checkedButton(). If a button is clicked
        the buttonClicked() signal is emitted. For a checkable button in an
        exclusive group this means that the button was checked. The list of
        buttons in the group is returned by buttons().

        In addition, MButtonGroup can map between integers and buttons. You
        can assign an integer id to a button with setId(), and retrieve it with
        id(). The id of the currently checked button is available with checkedId(),
        and there is an overloaded signal buttonClicked() which emits the id of
        the button. The purpose of the mapping mechanism is to simplify the
        representation of enum values in a user interface.

    \section MButtonGroupUseGuidelines Usage guidelines
        - The button group should have a visualization that ties the buttons in
          the group together.
        - The button group can have a minimum of 2 buttons.
        - The button group component should try to take all the width that is
          available for the group if possible.
        - The button group should automatically wrap into multiple lines if not all
          components fit into one line.

    \section MButtonGroupInteractions Interactions
        - Tap down an unselected button
            - Highlights the tapped button, does not change currently selected
              button.
        - Single tap on unselected button
            - Selected state moves from previously selected button to tapped one.
              Performs possible additional action defined by application.
        - Single tap on already selected button
            - Button remains selected, nothing else happens.
        - Drag selected button onto adjacent button
            - Original button remains selected, adjacent button will not get
              selected.

    \section MButtonGroupOpenIssues Open issues
        - Should button group be always exclusive?
        - The button group should have a visualization that ties the buttons in
          the group together. How to implement this?
        - Should the group handle the positioning of the buttons?

    \section MButtonGroupExamples Examples
        Adding buttons to group:
        \code
        //create button group
        MButtonGroup* buttonGroup = new MButtonGroup();

        //add buttons to group
        MButton* buttons[5];
        for( int i=0; i < 5; ++i) {
            buttons[i] = new MButton("Button" + QString::number(i));
            buttons[i]->setViewType(MButton::toggleType);
            buttons[i]->setCheckable(true);
            buttonGroup->addButton(buttons[i]);
        }

        //connect to button interaction signals
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonPressed(MButton*)), this, SLOT(groupButtonPressed(MButton*)));
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonReleased(MButton*)), this, SLOT(groupButtonReleased(MButton*)));
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonClicked(MButton*)), this, SLOT(groupButtonClicked(MButton*)));

        //you can add non-checkable buttons in group as well
        MButton* button = new MButton();
        buttonGroup->addButton(button);

        //and maybe later set them as checkable
        button->setCheckable(true);

        //remove button
        buttonGroup->removeButton(buttons[0]);

        //the group does not free the added buttons they need to be manually deleted by the user
        //when deleting a button it is automatically removed from the group it belongs
        delete button;
        for( int i=0; i<5; ++i)
            delete buttons[i];
        \endcode

        User defined button ids in a group:
        \code
        //create button group
        MButtonGroup* buttonGroup = new MButtonGroup();

        //add buttons with user define ids to group
        MButton* buttons[5];
        for( int i=0; i < 5; ++i) {
            buttons[i] = new MButton("Button" + QString::number(i));
            buttons[i]->setViewType(MButton::toggleType);
            buttons[i]->setCheckable(true);
            buttonGroup->addButton(buttons[i], i);
        }

        //connect to button interaction signals
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonPressed(MButton*)), this, SLOT(groupButtonPressed(MButton*)));
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonReleased(MButton*)), this, SLOT(groupButtonReleased(MButton*)));
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonClicked(MButton*)), this, SLOT(groupButtonClicked(MButton*)));

        //when giving ids for buttons signals with button ids are emitted by buttongroup in
        //addition of the normal signals, when ids are not assigned these signals are not emitted
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonPressed(int)), this, SLOT(groupButtonPressed(int)));
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonReleased(int)), this, SLOT(groupButtonReleased(int)));
        connect(buttonGroup, SIGNAL(buttonClicked(int)), this, SLOT(groupButtonClicked(int)));

        //fetch button by id
        MButton* button = buttonGroup->button(2);

        //fetch id of a button
        int id = buttonGroup->id(button);
        \endcode
