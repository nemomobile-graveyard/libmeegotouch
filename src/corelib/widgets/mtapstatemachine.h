    \class MTapStateMachine
    \brief MTapStateMachine is state machine class which can be used to
    control the higlighting and unhilighting of a widget in response to mouse events.

    It is a private class used inside MeegoTouch library and should not be used by
    client applications.

    The class will introduce an initial delay before the highlight should be shown,
    which is useful if the target widget is going to be used in a list and should
    not be highlighted when the user executes panning gesture.

    It will also introduce a delay before sending a release signal if the user
    fast-taps the widget, which improves the feedback visualisation.
