/*!
 * \class DuiApplication
 * \brief DuiApplication manages the GUI application's control flow and main settings.
 *
 * DuiApplication instance automatically extracts application name from the arguments
 * given in the constructor. It also loads css - stylesheet, svg file and adds application
 * specific image paths to the pixmap search paths used by the current DuiTheme instance.
 *
 * CSS and SVG files are searched for in order from the following places:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Directory in which application was launched.</li>
 *   <li>Application specific theme path (global theme path appended with the application name)</li>
 *   <li>Global theme path (Qt data path appended by themes/dui)</li>
 * </ol>
 * When first instance of CSS or SVG file is found it is loaded to the current DuiTheme.
 * Also image - subdirectory of each of the aforementioned paths is appended to the pixmap search
 * paths used by DuiTheme.
 *
 * DuiApplication will also create a QDBus service with name made by prepending 'com.nokia.' to
 * the application name provided in the constructor (or the binary name if no name is provided
 * in the constructor). It will provide an interface called DuiApplicationIf which calls service
 * methods in an instance of DuiApplicationService. By default, DuiApplication will construct an
 * instance of DuiApplicationService, but the application programmer can derive a class from
 * DuiApplicationService and provide a pointer to that in the constructor for DuiApplication to
 * use instead. This way, the application programmer can override the methods in
 * DuiApplicationService and change the behaviour of the application's interface.
 *
 * The default behaviour is to only allow a single instance of any
 * application. When an application is launched, it attempts to register
 * itself as a dbus service (as above). Only the first instance of the
 * application will be successful, and subsequent attempts will fail. When
 * dbus registration fails, the default behaviour is to call the first
 * instance's DuiApplicationService launch() method, and then quit. This
 * causes the first instance to become visible (raises the window).
 *
 * If other behaviour is required, for example if you want multiple
 * instances of an application, then it is necessary to derive a class from
 * DuiApplicationService and override its methods.
